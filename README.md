## 📖 Project Manifesto
The **MapCapIPO** engine is a high-fidelity community application running within the **Pi Browser**. It is engineered to reproduce a traditional stock market **Initial Public Offering (IPO)** of Map of Pi equity ownership on the blockchain. By leveraging a dual-pool minting strategy, this protocol eliminates the **"low-price-race"** and guarantees a structural **20% capital appreciation** for early participants.

## 📈 Strategic Financial Features (Philip’s Vision)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Alpha Advantage**: All IPO pioneers purchase at the same price, receiving a 20% gain at LP launch.

* **Water-Level Pricing**: Dynamic calculation where `Spot-Price = IPO_MapCap / Total_Pi_Contributed`.
* **Institutional Vesting**: Strategic 10-month release schedule (10% monthly) after LP commencement.
* **Dividend Protocol**: Automated distribution of **10% of Map of Pi profits** to MapCap holders.
* **Fixed Duration**: The IPO phase is strictly limited to four calendar weeks.

## 🛡️ Security Integrity (Daniel’s Standards)

### 1️⃣ Whale-Shield v4.0
No single entity can monopolize the IPO. Any stake exceeding **10%** of the pool is automatically identified and refunded via **A2UaaS**.

### 2️⃣ Immutable Audit Trail
Every system calculation and transaction is recorded in detailed logs to maintain Daniel's security and transparency standards.

### 3️⃣ UTC Synchronization
Strict adherence to the **Gregorian calendar (UTC)** for all snapshots and price points to prevent manipulation.

## 📊 Dashboard Intelligence: The Four Essential Values
The backend delivers a unified data object optimized for the Pi Browser smartphone UI:
1.  **Total Investors**: Number of unique pioneers who have deposited investments.
2.  **Global Water-Level**: Total amount of pi invested by all pioneers to date.
3.  **Individual Stake**: Total balance of the current user's pi in the IPO wallet.
4.  **Capital Gain Projection**: Real-time projection of the 20% increase in pi value.
